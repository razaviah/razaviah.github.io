**Supervisor:** Prof. Garg  
**Type:** Academic Project (Artificial Intelligence, AI Agents)

## Overview
This project, led by Prof. Garg, involved designing agents for the two-player board game 'Four in a Row'. The game's objective is to be the first to form a line of four discs in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal arrangement on a seven-column, six-row grid. This project required implementing three specific algorithms for the game's AI agents.

## Methodology
The project's methodology included:
1. **Minimax Implementation:** Developing a depth-limited minimax algorithm for searching to an arbitrary depth within the game tree.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Implementing alpha-beta pruning to enhance the efficiency of the minimax search as the tree depth increases.
3. **Expectimax Algorithm:** Modeling probabilistic behaviors of opponents through the expectimax algorithm, using chance nodes to simulate suboptimal decisions made by opponents.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of the project was conducted through:
- **Game Simulation:** Using a provided GUI to simulate the game and test the performance of the implemented algorithms.
- **Algorithm Testing:** Running adversarial searches within the game, with the AI agent playing as the MAX player against different opponent types.
- **Functionality Verification:** Ensuring the algorithms correctly execute game strategies and make optimal decisions based on the game state.

## Key Findings
- Successful integration and functioning of minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax algorithms in the game environment.
- Effective modeling of opponent behaviors and decision-making processes in the game.
- Enhanced gameplay experience and strategic depth achieved through the implementation of advanced AI algorithms.

## Personal Contributions
- **Complete Project Development:** Solely responsible for the entire project development, including the implementation of all algorithms and integration with the game environment.
- **Algorithm Design and Optimization:** Designed and optimized the minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax algorithms for effective gameplay.
- **GUI Integration and Testing:** Integrated the algorithms with the provided GUI and conducted extensive testing to ensure optimal performance and user experience.
