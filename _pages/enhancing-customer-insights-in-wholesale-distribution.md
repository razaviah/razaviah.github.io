**Supervisor:** Prof. Garg
**Type:** Academic Project

## Overview
This project, under the supervision of Prof. Garg, focused on analyzing the data of clients of a wholesale distributor. The goal was to describe the variation in the different types of customers by analyzing their annual spending across various product categories.

## Methodology
The methodology for the project included:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting EDA and performing any necessary data cleaning.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Implementing and comparing MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for data normalization, and selecting the most appropriate scaler.
3. **Optimal Feature Selection:** Using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) to find the optimal number of features and plotting the relationship between the number of features selected and cross-validation score.
4. **KMeans Clustering:** Implementing KMeans Clustering for K values ranging from 2 to 15 and identifying the optimum number of clusters using the elbow method.
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Conducting PCA with the original number of features to determine how much variance is explained by the first 2 and first 4 components, and visualizing the clusters.
6. **XGBoost Classifier Implementation:** Implementing an XGBoost Classifier with 5-Fold Cross-Validation and reporting the performance metrics.

## Evaluation
The project evaluation focused on:
- **Data Insights and Patterns:** Analyzing the patterns and insights derived from the EDA and feature scaling processes.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Assessing the effectiveness of the KMeans Clustering and PCA in grouping similar types of customers.
- **Model Performance:** Evaluating the performance of the XGBoost Classifier in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Key Findings
- Identified key spending patterns and customer segments from the wholesale distributor's client data.
- Determined the optimal number of customer clusters and visualized them effectively.
- Demonstrated the efficacy of the XGBoost Classifier in predicting customer categories based on their spending habits.

## Personal Contributions
- **Complete Project Implementation:** Led the entire project, including data analysis, feature scaling, clustering, PCA, and classifier implementation.
- **Data Cleaning and EDA:** Conducted thorough data cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand customer spending patterns.
- **Feature Scaling and Selection:** Implemented and compared different scaling techniques, and used RFECV for optimal feature selection.
- **Clustering and PCA:** Executed KMeans Clustering and PCA to uncover customer segments and visualized the results.
- **Classifier Development:** Developed and fine-tuned an XGBoost Classifier model, assessing its performance with cross-validation.

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed the wholesale distributor's customer data, providing valuable insights into customer behaviors and segmentation. The implementation of advanced data analysis techniques, such as clustering and machine learning classifiers, highlighted the potential of data-driven approaches in understanding customer dynamics in the wholesale industry.
