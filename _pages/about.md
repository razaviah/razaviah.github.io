Welcome! My name is Amirhossein Razavi. I am a first-year MASc student at Toronto Metropolitan University, studying under the supervision of Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri. I hold an Honours Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from York University, with expertise in NLP, AI, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering. I previously worked at Beam Data as a Data Engineer Consultant, where I contributed to healthcare data migration and developed SEO data pipelines, refining my skills in Apache Airflow and PySpark. My work is fueled by a passion for advancing knowledge and innovation, especially in AI and data science.

A highlight of my academic journey was my [capstone project](https://razaviah.github.io/projects/dataset-generation-and-evaluation-for-natural-question-generation) under the supervision of [Prof. An](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2eUL7eEAAAAJ), where I focused on Dataset Generation and Evaluation for Natural Question Generation. This project aimed to create and evaluate a new dataset for natural question generation, emphasizing the practical use of natural-sounding questions in real-world applications. Utilizing state-of-the-art NLP models like BART and T5, I focused on generating and validating a dataset that effectively aids in natural question generation tasks. This experience honed my research skills and deepened my interest in advanced NLP techniques, setting a solid foundation for my future academic pursuits.

As I aspire to further my education in graduate school, I'm eager to explore advanced research opportunities in **Data Science**, **Applied Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning Operations**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**, and **Information Retrieval**. My work reflects a commitment to excellence and a readiness to contribute to groundbreaking researchs in these fields.
