## Academic Projects

[Dataset Generation, and Evaluation for Natural Question Generation
:   Supervisor: Prof. An
:   Type: Academic Project (Capstone Project, NLP, NQG)
:
:   This project aimed to create and evaluate a new dataset for natural question generation, emphasizing the practical use of natural-sounding questions in real-world applications. Utilizing state-of-the-art NLP models like BART and T5, the project focused on generating and validating a dataset that effectively aids in natural question generation tasks.](https://razaviah.github.io/projects/dataset-generation-and-evaluation-for-natural-question-generation)

[Enhancing Customer Insights in Wholesale Distribution](https://razaviah.github.io/projects/enhancing-customer-insights-in-wholesale-distribution)
:   Supervisor: Prof. Garg
:   Type: Academic Project (Data Analysis, Machine Learning)
:   
:   Focusing on a wholesale distributor's client data, this project employs advanced techniques like EDA, KMeans clustering, and PCA for deep customer behavior analysis. It explores feature scaling methods and RFECV for feature optimization, and leverages XGBoost for predictive modeling, offering a comprehensive view of customer segmentation in wholesale distribution.

#dowork
:   Coined by Rob Dyrdek and his personal body guard Christopher "Big Black" Boykins, "Do Work" works as a self motivator, to motivating your friends.

Do It Live
