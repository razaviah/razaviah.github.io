## Academic Projects

<a href="https://razaviah.github.io/projects/benchmarking-prompt-sensitivity-in-large-language-models" target="_blank">Benchmarking Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models</a>
:   **Supervisor:** Prof. Bagheri
:   **Type:** Research Publication, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs)
:   **Project Materials:** Includes Research Paper, Poster, and GitHub Repository
:   
:   This research introduces the Prompt Sensitivity Prediction task and PromptSET dataset, investigating how slight variations in prompt formulation impact LLM performance. Using 11,469 prompts with 9 variations each from TriviaQA and HotpotQA datasets, the study benchmarks multiple approaches including LLM self-evaluation, text classification, and query performance prediction methods. Findings reveal that existing methods struggle with prompt sensitivity prediction, highlighting the need for specialized approaches to help users craft more reliable prompts.


<a href="https://razaviah.github.io/projects/query-performance-prediction-via-llm-generated-query-variations" target="_blank">Query Performance Prediction via LLM-Generated Query Variations</a>
:   **Supervisor:** Prof. Ensan
:   **Type:** Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP)
:   **Project Materials:** Includes Project Report, and GitHub Repository
:   
:   This project explores Query Performance Prediction (QPP) through Large Language Model–generated query variations. Instead of embedding-space perturbations like ADG-QPP, it uses LLMs (LLaMA 3.1) to produce semantically equivalent queries evaluated with BM25 retrieval. The approach offers interpretable, natural-language robustness estimation and achieves strong correlation performance especially on challenging queries showing LLM based QPP as a viable alternative to dense methods.
