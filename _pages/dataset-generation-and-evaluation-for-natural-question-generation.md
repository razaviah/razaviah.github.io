**Supervisor:** Prof. An  
**Type:** Academic Project (Capstone Project, NLP, NQG)

## Overview
This capstone project focuses on developing and evaluating a novel dataset for natural question generation (NQG). Aimed at bridging the gap in sentence-based natural question answering datasets, this project utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models, including BART and T5, to generate and validate a dataset conducive to practical NQG applications.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Creation:** Utilizing the Google Natural Questions (NQ) corpus, refining it to construct a more targeted dataset.
2. **Data Parsing and Coreference Resolution:** Implementing sophisticated data parsing techniques and coreference resolution using AllenNLPâ€™s library.
3. **Question Generation:** Employing sequence-to-sequence models, focusing on generating questions using BART and T5 algorithms.

## Evaluation
- **Automatic Evaluation:** Using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE.
- **Test Runs:** Conducting tests on different datasets, like the Car Manual Dataset.
- **Human Evaluation:** Engaging human evaluators for assessing the naturalness and relevance of questions.

## Key Findings
- Development of the Coreference Resolved Sentence-based Natural Question Dataset (CRSNQD).
- BART and T5 models showed promising results in both automatic and human evaluations.
- Highlighted the need for improved automatic evaluation methods for NQG.

## Personal Contributions
- Developed Coref Resolved SNQD.
- Comprehensive evaluations of BART and T5 models.
- Insights into text processing and model training in NLP.

## Conclusion
The project represents a significant step in NQG, offering a robust dataset and insights into model evaluations, paving the way for future research in NLP.
