**Supervisor:** Prof. Lesperance 
**Type:** Academic Project

## Overview
This project, under the supervision of Prof. Lesperance, focused on evaluating the Clingo Answer Set Programming (ASP) Solver. The Clingo ASP system is designed for grounding and solving logic-based problems, widely applicable in combinatorial problem-solving across various computer science domains.

## Methodology
The methodology of the project was observational, involving:
1. **Software Utilization:** Using the online version of Clingo available on the Potassco website, with features ranging from pre-built to custom problem solving.
2. **Problem Selection:** A variety of problems with varying complexity were selected for testing Clingo's features.
3. **Data Collection:** Analyzing the types of solutions provided by Clingo, and assessing the resources required by the software in solving them&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;.

## Evaluation
The evaluation focused on:
- **Effectiveness and Speed:** Assessing Clingo’s performance in solving problems of different complexities quickly and efficiently.
- **Usability:** Examining the ease of learning and using Clingo’s syntax compared to other modeling languages.
- **Comparison with SModels:** Contrasting Clingo's performance with another ASP system, SModels, to identify strengths and weaknesses&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;.

## Key Findings
- Clingo demonstrated high efficiency in solving a range of problems, from simple to complex, with minimal time requirements.
- It was observed that Clingo outperformed SModels in terms of speed, especially in handling larger problem sets.
- The study highlighted the robustness of Clingo in dealing with large and complex datasets, albeit some limitations in specific scenarios&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;.
